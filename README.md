Hi!

This repo is to showcase my projects, skills, and resume.

About me:

My name is Kayli (Kay) Grum. I graduate in December 2023 with a
Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science (GPA: 3.40). I am concentrating in
Human-Computer Interaction and minoring in Psychology.

My main skill is Java, although I also have experience in SQL, HTML/CSS,
C#, JavaScript, and Python through school. I am open to many career paths,
but I would especially enjoy something in UX. I've taken Human-Centered Design
and Rapid Prototyping and I loved them both.

In my free time, I like to read, play chess, and hang out with friends/family.

Best and thank you for reading,

Kay Grum
