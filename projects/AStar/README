Program that uses the A* algorithm to generate a path. Allows user to choose
a starting location and a goal location using x and y coordinates. Uses the
Manhattan method for calculating the heuristic.

The output is an updating 15x15 2D, where a 'P' goes step-by-step along the
shortest path. In the grid, an 'x' is an unpathable node, and a '_' is 
an empty node.
