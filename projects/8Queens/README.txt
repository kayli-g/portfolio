This project uses a Hill-Climbing Algorithm to place 8 Queens on 
a chessboard in a way that doesn't allow them to capture each other.

The chessboard is represented by a 8x8 2d array. Queens are represented
by 1s and empty spaces are represented by 0s. 

The final output is a printed 2d array where no more than one
Queen is in any row, column, or diagonal.
